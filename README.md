  ## Description
  
  * This week, I was not given any starter code and was tasked with creating a social network API that uses a NoSQL database so that the website will be able to handle large amounts of unstructured data. Once the application is started from the command line, it should start the server and the Mongoose models should be connected to the MongoDB database. From here, the user should be able to run routes through insomnia to GET all users, GET a single user by its ID, POST (create) a new user, PUT (update) a user by its ID, and DELETE a user by its ID. In addition, users should be able to do a POST request to add a new friend to a user's friend list, as well as DELETE a friend from a user's friend list. Next, users should also be able to GET all thoughts, GET a single thought by its ID, POST (create) a new thought, PUT (update) a thought by its ID, and DELETE a thought by its ID. In addition to this, users should be able to POST (create) a reaction to another user's thought, as well as DELETE a reaction to another user's thought if they choose to.
